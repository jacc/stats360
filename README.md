# ðŸ‘‹ RIP Stats360

Stats360.co was a Life360 dashboard that was built by myself and [Alistair Smith](https://alistair.sh) in 2020/2021. The site was super awesome, and we even scaled up to hundreds of thousands of users that came from our TikTok virality, featured here: [[1]](https://www.tiktok.com/@verboseboot/video/7073848276545555755) [[2]](https://www.tiktok.com/@verboseboot/video/7075768406833777963) [[2]](https://www.tiktok.com/@verboseboot/video/7074945782809480491) 

A huge thank you to Chris Hulls, the CEO of Life360, for allowing us to even keep it running for as long as it did. While it definitely opened up some liability from them, it was handled fantasticly by their entire team and I'm so incredibly thankful for the experience.

The site doesn't work now because of some changes to Life360's API, so this is more of just an archive than anything ele.

I [published an article](https://jack.bio/blog/life360) over on my blog if you're interested in the story of how it was built.
